# UFOs
## Tools used for this Project
  * JavaScript
  * HTML
  * CSS
  * Bootstrap
  * VS Code

## Overview of the Project:

The purpose of this project is to help Dana build an interactive webpage "UFO Sightings", funded by "W.Avy" that allows ufologist and sceptics alike to search for data around UFO sightings. Visitors to this webpage will have the abiility to view and search for data by using a dynamic table that will be built using HTML and JavaScript; the page will be beautified using elements of CSS and Bootstrap. 

## Results:

###### Creation of Webpage (Image 1)

* The webpage greets users with a beautiful jumbotron. To produce the background picture, the position and size of the text, a combination of HTML text was used, and CSS and Bootstrap.

###### Creation of Interactive Table Image (1 - 5)

* An interactive table was created using HTML and JavaScript.  This table will allow users to search for UFO sightings using filters: Date, City, State, Country and Shape(of sighting) If a user should clear all fields the user will view "all" results, that is the results will be unfiltered.

Users can search based on built in "Filter ID's"

###### Filter ID's 
* Date - Users can search by date in the format of __day/month/year__ (Image 2)

## Summary:

The UFOs webpage was sucessful in terms of the elements of the planned project were completed.  The webpage is interactic with a dynamic table that allows urology enthusiast and even sceptics to search for reported sightings of UFO's based on five(5) different criteria.
One of the __drawbacks__ of this webpage is that the user has no true determinant of choosing a filter that would produce results, in terms of dates, cities or states that sightings may have occured. A secondary filter within the existing filters should prodvide a drop-down list with all possible list items; for example a clickable list of only cities for which there were sightings.  This paired with a pop-up message box of "Null" to indicate to the user that this filter is not producing results because there are none to display. 

###### Recommendations
Two additional recommendations for further development of this webpage are: 
* 1) A user entry box that excepts information on sightings that can be entered using the existing filter id's, and the ability to upload images of the sightings
* 2) Social Media buttons should be added to the page, as they say "Birds of a feather flock together", it is likely that urology enthusiats have friends who are also enthusiasts. The ability of users to share links on their "FB", "Instagram" and other social platforms can both bring more users to the page and possible more amazing reports of "sightings"
